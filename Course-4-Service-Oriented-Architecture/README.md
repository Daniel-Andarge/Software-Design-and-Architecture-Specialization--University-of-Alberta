**Module Overview:**

1. **Introduction to Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA):**

   - Understand the core principles of SOA and its significance in modern software development.
   - Explore the benefits of adopting an SOA approach in building scalable and interoperable systems.

2. **Understanding Web Technologies:**

   - Delve into the technologies that power the Internet and the World Wide Web.
   - Gain insights into protocols such as HTTP, TCP/IP, DNS, and others that facilitate communication over the web.

3. **Exploring Web Services Precursors:**
   - Investigate the predecessors of service-oriented architecture, tracing back the evolution of distributed computing.
   - Learn about early middleware solutions and their role in laying the groundwork for modern SOA practices.

**Learning Objectives:**

1. **Describe the technologies that enable the Internet and World Wide Web:**

   - Gain a comprehensive understanding of the foundational technologies that form the backbone of the Internet.
   - Explain the roles of protocols like HTTP, TCP/IP, and DNS in facilitating communication and resource sharing on the web.

2. **Describe service-oriented architectures based on middleware:**
   - Define the concept of middleware and its significance in enabling communication between distributed components.
   - Understand how service-oriented architectures leverage middleware to build loosely coupled, interoperable systems.
