## Module 1: Exploring Web Technologies

Welcome to the first module of my Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) journey! In this module, we will embark on a comprehensive exploration of service-oriented architectures and their foundational principles. Additionally, we'll delve into the technologies that serve as the backbone of the World Wide Web, laying the groundwork for our understanding of web services in subsequent modules.

### Learning Objectives:

- Gain a comprehensive understanding of service-oriented architectures and their fundamental principles.
- Explore the core technologies that power the Internet and the World Wide Web.
- Understand the significance of earlier precursors to service-oriented architecture in the evolution of distributed computing.

### Module Overview:

In this module, we'll start by unraveling the core principles of service-oriented architectures, providing you with a solid foundation to grasp their significance in modern software development practices. We'll then transition into a crash course on the essential technologies that underpin the web, including protocols like HTTP, TCP/IP, and DNS. By comprehending these technologies, you'll be well-prepared to delve deeper into the realm of web services in the subsequent modules.

So, let's embark on this exciting journey of discovery into the world of service-oriented architectures and web technologies. Together, we'll unlock the keys to building scalable, interoperable systems that drive innovation in today's digital landscape.
