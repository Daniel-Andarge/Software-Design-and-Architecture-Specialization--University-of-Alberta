## Module 3 - REST Architecture for SOA

This module explore the REST (Representational State Transfer) architecture for Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), a paradigm that has gained significant traction for its simplicity and effectiveness in building scalable and interoperable systems.

### Overview

RESTful web services represent a lightweight alternative to traditional WS\*-style services, leveraging simple HTTP methods and embracing statelessness and resource-oriented design. As a result, they have become the preferred choice for many modern web applications due to their ease of use and flexibility.

### Key Concepts

In this module, you will delve into the following key concepts:

1. **REST Principles:** Learn about the fundamental principles that govern RESTful design, including statelessness, uniform interface, client-server architecture, and cacheability. Understand how these principles contribute to the scalability and reliability of RESTful services.

2. **HTTP and URI:** Explore the role of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) in RESTful architecture. Understand how resources are represented and manipulated using HTTP requests and how URIs are structured to provide meaningful access points.

3. **JSON over HTTP:** Discover how JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) serves as the preferred data format for representing resources in RESTful services. Learn about the benefits of JSON for data interchange and how it enhances interoperability between client and server components.

4. **System Design with REST:** Gain practical experience in designing systems using REST interfaces. Learn how to architect scalable and maintainable systems by adhering to RESTful design principles and leveraging the power of HTTP for communication.

5. **API Design Best Practices:** Identify the principles of good API design and learn how to create RESTful APIs that are intuitive, efficient, and developer-friendly. Explore topics such as versioning, error handling, pagination, and authentication in the context of RESTful APIs.

6. **Microservices Architecture:** Understand the concept of microservices architecture as an alternative approach to building applications based on small, independent services. Explore the benefits of microservices, such as scalability, resilience, and ease of deployment, and learn how to design and manage microservices-based systems effectively.

### Learning Objectives

- Identify the core principles of RESTful design and understand their significance in building scalable and interoperable systems.
- Apply REST architecture principles, including JSON over HTTP and URI structuring, to design and implement RESTful services.
- Create a system architecture using RESTful interfaces that adhere to best practices in API design and promote ease of use and maintainability.
- Understand the principles of good API design and apply them to develop RESTful APIs that meet the needs of developers and consumers.
- Gain insights into microservices architecture and its benefits, and learn how to design and manage microservices-based systems effectively in real-world scenarios.
