# Module 3.1 - Microservices

## Overview

Module delves into the realm of microservices architecture, a modern approach to building software systems that emphasizes loosely coupled, independently deployable services. This module explores the principles, benefits, and challenges associated with microservices, equipping learners with the knowledge to design, implement, and manage microservices-based applications effectively.

## Key Concepts

- **Microservices Architecture**: Understanding the concept of breaking down large monolithic applications into smaller, self-contained services.
- **Decomposition Strategies**: Techniques for identifying and decomposing monolithic applications into microservices.
- **Service Communication**: Exploring different methods of inter-service communication in a microservices architecture.
- **Service Discovery and Orchestration**: Tools and techniques for dynamically discovering and orchestrating microservices.
- **Scalability and Resilience**: Strategies for scaling and ensuring resilience in microservices-based applications.
- **Testing and Deployment**: Best practices for testing, deploying, and managing microservices.

## Learning Objectives

- Gain a comprehensive understanding of microservices architecture and its principles.
- Learn decomposition strategies to break down monolithic applications into microservices.
- Explore various communication patterns and tools for inter-service communication.
