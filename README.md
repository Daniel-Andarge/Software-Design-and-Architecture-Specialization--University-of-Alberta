# Software Design and Architecture Specialization

**About the Specialization:**
In the [Software Design and Architecture Specialization](#), I mastered the application of design principles, patterns, and architectures to build reusable and flexible software applications and systems. I learned how to express and document software system designs visually, using Unified Modeling Language (UML).

**Practical Learning:**
Engaging in practical examples allowed me to apply my knowledge, developing employable skills and expertise relevant to the software industry.

## Applied Learning Project

**Capstone Project: Java-based Android Application**
The culmination of this specialization involved a Java-based Android application. Progressing through the four courses, I evolved the app from a single-user local data storage to a multi-user app with remote data storage. Each course provided a Java codebase as a starting point, challenging me to document and implement new features based on course knowledge.

Tutorials were available to help me understand the starter codebase and grasp the basics of Android development.

## Prerequisites

Basic Java programming knowledge was expected. The capstone application required the use of Android Studio, an integrated development environment. I explored tutorials for [Windows](link-to-windows-tutorial) or [Mac](link-to-mac-tutorial) to familiarize myself with Android Studio.
