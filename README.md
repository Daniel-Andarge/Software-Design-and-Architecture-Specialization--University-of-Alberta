# Software Design and Architecture Specialization

**About the Specialization:**
In the Software Design and Architecture Specialization, you'll master the application of design principles, patterns, and architectures to build reusable and flexible software applications and systems. Learn how to express and document software system designs visually, using Unified Modeling Language (UML).

**Practical Learning:**
Engage in practical examples to apply your knowledge, developing employable skills and expertise relevant to the software industry.

## Applied Learning Project

**Capstone Project: Java-based Android Application**
The culmination of this specialization involves a Java-based Android application. Progress through the four courses, evolving the app from a single-user local data storage to a multi-user app with remote data storage. Each course provides a Java codebase as a starting point, challenging you to document and implement new features based on course knowledge.

Tutorials are available to help you understand the starter codebase and grasp the basics of Android development.

## Prerequisites

Basic Java programming knowledge is expected. The capstone application requires the use of Android Studio, an integrated development environment. Explore tutorials for [Windows](link-to-windows-tutorial) or [Mac](link-to-mac-tutorial) to familiarize yourself with Android Studio.
