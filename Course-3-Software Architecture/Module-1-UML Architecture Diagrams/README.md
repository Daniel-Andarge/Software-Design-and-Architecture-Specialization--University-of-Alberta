# Module 1: UML Architecture Diagrams

## What I've Learned

I've delved deep into the significance of software architecture, understanding its pivotal role in crafting robust systems. Throughout this learning journey, I've uncovered the various perspectives that must be considered when structuring software architecture. Moreover, I've acquired skills in effectively communicating architectural designs using Unified Modeling Language (UML).

## Learning Objectives:

Here are the key objectives I've pursued in this module:

1. **Craft UML Package Diagrams:**

   - Understand the organizational structure of a system using UML package diagrams.
   - I've mastered the art of creating UML package diagrams, providing a visual representation of the organization and structure of a software system.

2. **Construct UML Component Diagrams:**

   - Dive into the world of component diagrams, gaining insights into how individual components interact within a system and contribute to its overall architecture.
   - Explore the relationships and dependencies between various components to ensure a cohesive architecture.

3. **Develop UML Deployment Diagrams:**
   - I've honed my skills in creating deployment diagrams, offering a comprehensive view of how software components are distributed across various nodes in a network.
   - Grasp the deployment aspect of software systems through UML deployment diagrams.
   - Learn how to represent the physical distribution of components across different nodes for efficient system execution.
