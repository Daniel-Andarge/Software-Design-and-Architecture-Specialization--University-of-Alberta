# My Software Architecture Journey

## Overview

In this course, I delved into the fascinating world of software architecture, exploring how various software components, such as subroutines, classes, and functions, were organized and interacted with each other. This organization and interaction collectively formed what we referred to as architecture. Throughout the course, I studied the representation of these architectures, both in UML and other visual tools.

I learn the most common architectural styles, their qualities, tradeoffs, and how they impacted our software development process. And we delved into the evaluation of architectures, understanding the characteristics of good architecture, and explored ways to enhance and improve it.

The pinnacle of my learning journey was the Capstone Project, where I documented a Java-based Android application. Utilizing UML diagrams, I illustrated the intricacies of the application's architecture and conducted a thorough analysis using the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM).

Upon completing this course, I acquired the skills to:

- Compare and contrast various architectural styles used in designing applications and systems, including main program and subroutine, object-oriented, interpreters, pipes and filters, database-centric, and event-based architectures.
- Articulate the properties of layered and n-tier architectures.
- Create UML package, component, and deployment diagrams to effectively express the architectural structure of a system.
- Explain the behavior of a system through the use of UML activity diagrams.
- Document a multi-application system with a layered architecture, showcasing my comprehensive understanding of software architecture principles.
