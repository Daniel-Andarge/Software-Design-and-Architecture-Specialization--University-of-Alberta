## Overview

Welcome to the assignment! To ensure a smooth completion process, review the provided lecture on the Command Pattern (2.2.4) as it will be instrumental in tackling the tasks ahead.

### Background

If you're new to this specialization, understand that the assignment revolves around enhancing an Android application's code base. The current project builds upon the Capstone assignments from a prior Object-Oriented Design course.

### Current State of the Application

In its present state, the application empowers the user (owner) to:

- Record and share owned items.
- View all items, available items, or borrowed items.
- Manage a list of contacts.
- Change the status of owned items between "Available" and "Borrowed."
- When an item is marked as "Borrowed," the owner must choose the borrower from their list of contacts.
- Edit or delete a contact, with the limitation that a contact cannot be altered or removed if currently borrowing an item.

## Submission Instructions

Once you've completed the tutorial and are ready to submit your code, adhere to the following steps:

1. **Include the Following Files in a Folder:**

   - `AddContactCommand.java`

   - `AddContactActivity.java`
   - `EditContactActivity.java`

2. **Compression:**

   - Compress the folder into a ZIP format.

3. **Submission Platform:**
