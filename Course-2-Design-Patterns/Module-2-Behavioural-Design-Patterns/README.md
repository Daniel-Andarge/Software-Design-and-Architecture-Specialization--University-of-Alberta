# Module 2 - Behavioral Design Patterns

## Overview

Let's revisit Module 2, where I continued to expand my repertoire of useful design patterns and added valuable tools to my arsenal. This module specifically focused on Behavioral Design Patterns, providing insights into their intent, applicability, and consequences. Throughout this module, I delved into effectively communicating these patterns through UML and translating theoretical knowledge into practical implementation by coding them in Java.

## Learning Objectives Achieved

Reflecting on this module, I successfully achieved the following learning objectives:

1. **Described Behavioral Design Patterns:**

   - _Intent, Applicability, and Consequences:_ Articulated the purpose, scope, and outcomes of various behavioral design patterns, including chain of responsibility, mediator, observer, state, and template method.

2. **Visualized Design Patterns Using UML:**

   - _UML Class Diagrams:_ Proficiently explained the structure of behavioral design patterns using UML class diagrams, enhancing my ability to represent and communicate these patterns effectively.

3. **Understood Design Pattern Behavior:**

   - _UML Sequence Diagrams:_ Acquired the skills to explain the behavior of behavioral design patterns through UML sequence diagrams, gaining insights into their dynamic aspects.

4. **Implemented Design Patterns in Java:**
   - _Java Realization:_ Derived Java implementations of behavioral design patterns, transforming theoretical knowledge into practical coding skills.
