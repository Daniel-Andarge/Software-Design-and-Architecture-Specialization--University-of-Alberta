# Course 2 - Design Patterns Journey

## Overview

Hello, and welcome to my journey through Course 2 - Design Patterns! In this course, I explored the integration of design patterns to enhance my understanding of object-oriented analysis and design, enabling the creation of sophisticated and interactive applications. Throughout the four modules, I delved into established design patterns, gaining insights into their applications and benefits in software development. Additionally, I honed my skills in identifying problematic software designs through a detailed examination of code smells.

## Key Modules

1. **Introduction to Design Patterns:** I delved into the fundamental concepts behind design patterns and their pivotal role in augmenting object-oriented analysis and design.

2. **Survey of Established Design Patterns:** I explored a variety of design patterns, gaining insights into their applications and benefits in software development.

3. **Capstone Project:** I applied my newfound knowledge to redesign an existing Java-based Android application, incorporating a combination of design patterns. I also critically assessed a provided Java codebase for code smells.

4. **Advanced Design Principles:** I mastered the application of design principles, including open-closed, dependency inversion, and least knowledge. This empowered me to identify and refactor anti-patterns, elevating the overall quality of my code.

5. **Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architectural Pattern:** I gained proficiency in applying the widely-used Model-View-Controller architectural pattern, a cornerstone in developing scalable and maintainable software.

## Learning Objectives Achieved

Upon completing this course, I am now equipped to:

- **Effectively Address User Interface Design Issues:** I can demonstrate the application of design patterns to overcome challenges in user interface design.

- **Select Appropriate Design Patterns:** I can identify and implement the most suitable design pattern to address specific application design problems.

- **Apply Design Principles:** I now utilize design principles such as open-closed, dependency inversion, and least knowledge to create robust and extensible software solutions.

- **Critique and Refactor Code:** I have developed the skills to critique code by recognizing and refactoring anti-patterns, ensuring the production of high-quality, maintainable code.

- **Implement Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern:** I can apply the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern to enhance the structure and scalability of my software projects.
