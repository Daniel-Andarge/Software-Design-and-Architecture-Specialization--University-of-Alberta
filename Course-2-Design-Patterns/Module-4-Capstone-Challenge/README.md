# My Capstone Challenge - Module 4

Throughout the preceding modules, I delved into diverse design patterns, implementing two of them in the Android code example. As I approach the concluding module of this course, my focus is on pinpointing and rectifying particular code smells within this code base. By successfully accomplishing these tasks, I will be well-prepared for the final exam.

## Learning Objectives

1. Recognize and refactor anti-patterns, commonly known as code smells.
2. Engage in a critical evaluation of the existing code.
