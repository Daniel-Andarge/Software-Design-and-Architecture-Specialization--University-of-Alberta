# Assignmet 2 Implement MVC Pattern

## Observer and MVC Patterns Assignment

This assignment focuses on implementing the Observer Pattern and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern in a Java application. The following files are included in the submission:

## Java Classes

- **Contact.java**: Represents a contact entity.
- **ContactList.java**: Manages a list of contacts.
- **ContactController.java**: Controller for managing individual contacts.
- **ContactListController.java**: Controller for managing the contact list.
- **AddContactActivity.java**: Handles adding new contacts.
- **EditContactActivity.java**: Manages the editing of existing contacts.

## Observer Pattern (2.2.5 Lecture)

The Observer Pattern is employed to establish a one-to-many dependency between objects. It allows multiple observers to be notified of changes to a subject's state. This pattern is crucial for implementing efficient communication between components.

## MVC Pattern (2.3.1 Lecture)

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern is used to separate the application into three interconnected components:

- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic.
- **View**: Displays the user interface.
- **Controller**: Handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly.

This pattern enhances code organization, maintainability, and collaboration among developers.
