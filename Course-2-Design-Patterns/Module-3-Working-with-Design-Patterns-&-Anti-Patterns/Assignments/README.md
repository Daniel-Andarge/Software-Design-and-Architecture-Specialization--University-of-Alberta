# Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

In Object-Oriented Programming, the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is a design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components:

- **Model:** Represents the data and business logic of the application.
- **View:** Displays the user interface and presents information to the user.
- **Controller:** Handles user input, manipulates the model, and updates the view accordingly.

The MVC pattern promotes a modular and organized structure, making it easier to manage and maintain complex software systems. It enhances code reusability and facilitates collaboration among developers by clearly defining the responsibilities of each component.

# Anti-Patterns in Software Engineering

## Overview

AntiPatterns, analogous to their design pattern counterparts, establish a shared industry vocabulary for identifying flawed procedures and implementations within organizations. This higher-level language facilitates effective communication among software developers, enabling concise explanations of more intricate ideas.

AntiPatterns provide practical insights into recognizing recurring issues in the software development business and offer comprehensive solutions to address the most common problems. By highlighting prevalent challenges within the software industry, AntiPatterns equips developers with the tools needed to identify these issues and determine their root causes.

## What Are Anti-Patterns?

An AntiPattern is a literary style that describes a typical resolution to an issue with undeniably unfavorable effects. This could result from a manager or developer lacking the necessary knowledge, expertise, or understanding to address a specific problem type or applying a well-intentioned pattern in an inappropriate situation.

## Different Types of Anti-Patterns

### Software Development AntiPatterns

Development Anti-Patterns primarily focus on practical software reworking techniques. Refactoring software involves updating code to enhance the software's architecture, facilitating future extensions and ongoing maintenance. The objective is typically to modify the code without impacting its functionality.

### Software Architecture AntiPatterns

Architecture Anti-Patterns concentrate on how applications and components are organized at the system and enterprise levels. Despite the relatively young discipline of software architecture, research and experience consistently underscore the overarching significance of architecture in software development.

### Software Project Management AntiPatterns

With over half of engineering work involving people and communication, Management Anti-Patterns highlight critical situations where ineffective communication of requirements hampers software development processes. Addressing these issues is vital for successful project management.
