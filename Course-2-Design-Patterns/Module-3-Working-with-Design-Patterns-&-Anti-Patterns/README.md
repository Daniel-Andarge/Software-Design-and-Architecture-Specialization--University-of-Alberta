# Module 3 - Working with Design Patterns & Anti-Patterns

## MVC Design Pattern and Software Design Principles

Welcome to my GitHub repository! In this project, I'm excited to share with you a valuable design pattern for user interfaces: the Model-View-Controller (MVC). By exploring this pattern, you'll gain insights into creating more organized and maintainable software.

## Learning Objectives

1. **Apply the MVC Architectural Pattern:** Understand and implement the Model-View-Controller pattern to enhance the structure and organization of your user interfaces.

2. **Apply Design Principles:** Explore essential design principles such as open-closed, dependency inversion, and least knowledge. Learn how to leverage these principles to build flexible, reusable, and scalable software solutions.

3. **Code Critique:** Develop the ability to critically evaluate code, identifying areas for improvement and optimization. Gain insights into creating code that not only works but is also elegant and efficient.

4. **Identify/Refactor Anti-patterns:** Recognize common code smells or antipatterns that can hinder software development. Learn how to refactor and improve code to eliminate these issues, enhancing the overall quality of your projects.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find resources and assignment projects related to MVC design pattern and fundamental software design principles. The aim is to create software that is not only functional but also adheres to best practices, making it easier to maintain and extend.
