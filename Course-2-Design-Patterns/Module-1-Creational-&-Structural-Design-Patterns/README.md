# Module 1 - Introduction to Design Patterns: Creational and Structural Patterns

## Overview

This module was crafted to impart knowledge and skills essential for addressing common design issues in object-oriented software through the application of design patterns. Throughout this module, I acquired a comprehensive understanding of creational and structural design patterns, expressing these designs in UML, and implementing them in Java.

## Learning Objectives Achieved

Reflecting on this module, I successfully achieved the following learning objectives:

1. **Described Creational Design Patterns:**

   - _Intent, Applicability, and Consequences:_ I articulated the purpose, scope, and outcomes of fundamental creational design patterns, such as the factory method and singleton.

2. **Visualized Design Patterns Using UML:**

   - _UML Class Diagrams:_ Proficiently represented the structure of design patterns using UML class diagrams, enhancing communication and documentation of software designs.

3. **Understood Design Pattern Behavior:**

   - _UML Sequence Diagrams:_ Acquired the skills to explain the behavior of design patterns through UML sequence diagrams, providing insights into their dynamic aspects.

4. **Implemented Design Patterns in Java:**

   - _Java Realization:_ Derived Java implementations of design patterns, translating theoretical knowledge into practical coding skills.

5. **Explored Structural Design Patterns:**
   - _Intent, Applicability, and Consequences:_ Expanded understanding by describing the purpose, applicability, and outcomes of structural design patterns, including adapter, composite, decorator, and proxy.
