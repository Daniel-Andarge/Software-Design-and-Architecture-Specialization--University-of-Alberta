## Assignment Guidelines: UML State Diagram

Welcome to the assignment! To assist you in completing the task successfully, please follow the steps outlined below:

### 1. Preliminary Review

Begin by revisiting the provided lecture material, specifically **Lecture 1.3.7 – UML State Diagram**, to reinforce your understanding of the concepts relevant to this assignment.

### 2. Code Analysis

Thoroughly examine the code responsible for adding a new item and editing an existing item. Focus on understanding how the system handles different states and conditions for items. Consider an item's availability ("Available" or "Borrowed") and whether it has an attached image or not.

### 3. State Diagram Creation

Your primary objective is to construct a UML State Diagram that effectively captures the four possible states of an item:

- Available without photo
- Available with photo
- Borrowed without photo
- Borrowed with photo

### 4. Transition Arrows and Labels

Ensure the State Diagram includes clear and appropriately labeled arrows indicating transitions between the identified states. Each transition should be labeled to articulate the conditions or actions triggering the state change.

### 5. Terminal State and Starting State

Don't forget to incorporate a terminal state to signify the end of the process, and indicate the starting state to establish the initial condition of the system.

### Example Format:

```plaintext
[Starting State] --> [Next State] : [Transition Label]
[Next State] --> [Terminal State] : [Transition Label]
...
```

### 6. Submission

Organize your UML State Diagram professionally and include it in your assignment submission. Feel free to use any standard UML notation that effectively communicates the states and transitions.

Remember, clarity and precision are key in conveying the system's behavior. Best of luck with your assignment!
