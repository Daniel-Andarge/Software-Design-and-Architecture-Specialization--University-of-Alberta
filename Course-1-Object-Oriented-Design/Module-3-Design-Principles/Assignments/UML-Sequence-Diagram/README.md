**Objective:**
Your task is to provide more details about the system by creating a UML sequence diagram. This diagram will illustrate how the system's classes interact when customers purchase flight tickets on the booking website.

**Customer Journey:**

1. **Search for Flights:**

   - Input desired location and departure/arrival date.
   - The website searches the database and returns available flights.

2. **Select and Add to Cart:**

   - Customer chooses a flight.
   - Adds the selected flight to their cart.

3. **Checkout Process:**

   - Initiates the checkout process.
   - Inputs payment information.

4. **Confirmation:**
   - System confirms the flight.
   - Empties the cart.
   - Displays a confirmation of the ticket for the selected flight.

This UML sequence diagram will serve as a communication tool for clients, providing a visual representation of the interactions within the system during the flight ticket purchasing process.
