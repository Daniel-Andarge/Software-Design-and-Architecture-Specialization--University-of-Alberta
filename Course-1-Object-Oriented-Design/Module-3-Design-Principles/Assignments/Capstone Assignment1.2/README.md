# Capstone Assignment 1.2 – UML Sequence Diagram

This assignment challenges you to apply your knowledge of object-oriented design by creating a UML sequence diagram from a provided code base.

[Code Base](https://github.com/Daniel-Andarge/Software-Design-and-Architecture-Specialization--University-of-Alberta/tree/main/Course-1-Object-Oriented-Design/Module-3-Design-Principles/Assignments/Capstone%20Assignment1.2/SharingApp_Starter_Code)

## Setup Instructions

1. Download, examine, and run the provided code base. This is the same starter code used in the previous Peer Review assignment.

2. You will be required to upload a PDF of your UML sequence diagram. You can use the free online tool [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) to create your diagram. Please note that you need to create an account to use this tool.

## Guidelines for the Assignment

Review the lecture [1.3.6 – UML Sequence Diagram](Link_to_Lecture_Here) to aid you in completing your assignment.

## How to Create Your Assignment

1. Review the code responsible for adding a new item.

2. Create a sequence diagram that captures the interactions of objects in the app when a new item is added.

3. Your sequence diagram should include the following classes:

   - AddItemActivity
   - ItemList
   - Dimensions
   - Item

4. Include calls to the following methods:

   - `onCreate()` (provided for you, see Template)
   - `loadItems()`
   - `saveItem()` (provided for you, see Template)
   - Dimensions constructor
   - Item constructor
   - `addItem()`
   - `saveItems()`

5. The activation of AddItemActivity should start with the call to `onCreate()`.

6. To get started, you can use the provided [template](https://github.com/Daniel-Andarge/Software-Design-and-Architecture-Specialization--University-of-Alberta/blob/main/Course-1-Object-Oriented-Design/Module-3-Design-Principles/Assignments/Capstone%20Assignment1.2/Template-1.2.pdf). Note that some methods/messages are provided for you. Add the missing messages to complete the diagram.
