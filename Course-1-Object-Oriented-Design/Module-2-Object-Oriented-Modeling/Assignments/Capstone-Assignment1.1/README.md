**Assignment Overview: UML Class Diagram for Item Sharing App**

This assignment tasks you with creating a UML class diagram for an item-sharing app. The app allows owners to record and share their items, view their availability, and change the status of items between "Available" and "Borrowed."

**User Stories:**

To better understand the app's scope, review the following user stories:

1. The owner can record items they own and wish to share.
2. The owner can view all items, their "Available" items, or their "Borrowed" items.
3. The owner can change an item's status from "Available" to "Borrowed" and vice versa.
4. When an item's status is changed to "Borrowed," the owner must enter the borrower's username.

**Assignment Guidelines:**

1. **Review Lectures:**

   - 1.2.7: Abstraction in Java and UML
   - 1.2.8: Encapsulation in Java and UML
   - 1.2.9: Decomposition in Java and UML
   - 1.2.10: Generalization with Inheritance in Java and UML

2. **Code Familiarity:**

   - Understand the current code where owners can record, view, and change the status of their items.

3. **Construct a UML Diagram:**

   - Utilize Lucidchart or a similar tool to create a UML class diagram.
   - Capture six classes: AppCompatActivity, AddItemActivity, EditItemActivity, ItemList, Item, Dimensions.
   - Represent three relationships: Aggregation, Composition, Inheritance.
   - Document all attributes and methods for each class.

4. **Use Template:**

   - Refer to the provided template to get started. The template includes Dependency relationships for reference (not mandatory for use).

5. **Style Guidelines:**
   - Illuminate crossing edges for clarity.
   - Avoid overlapping boxes or edges.
   - Ensure the diagram flows from top to bottom and left to right.

**Submission Instructions:**

- Create your UML class diagram using the provided template or your preferred format.
- Save the diagram as a PDF file.
- Upload the PDF to the submission platform.

**Note:**

- Your diagram does not need to match the template exactly.
- No requirement for specific colors; focus on clarity and structure.
- This assignment aims to reinforce your understanding of abstraction, encapsulation, decomposition, and generalization in Java and UML.

Thank you for your dedication to this assignment. Happy diagramming!
