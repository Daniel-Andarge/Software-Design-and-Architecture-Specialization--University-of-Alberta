## Submission Instructions

### Part 1: Translate UML to Java Code

1. Write Java code for the following classes:

   - `Contact.java`
   - `ContactList.java`

2. Organize these files in a folder.

3. Compress the folder into a ZIP archive. (Windows users can use 7zip or WinRAR.)

4. Upload the ZIP archive where prompted.

### Part 2: Demo Video

To assess the correctness of your code, submit a demo video (5 minutes or less) showcasing the following steps as a continuous interaction without crashes (if possible):

1. Start the video from the `MainActivity`.
2. Navigate to the `ContactsActivity` from the `MainActivity`.
3. Add a new contact to the contact list from the `ContactsActivity`. Demonstrate entering a username and email, saving the contact.
4. Edit a contact by selecting (long clicking) on a contact in the list. Update the email address.
5. Delete a contact.
6. Return to the `MainActivity` and view available items.
7. Add an item to your inventory (if not already available).
8. Edit an item by long-clicking. Toggle the status from "Available" to "Borrowed" and indicate the borrower's name. Allow selecting a different borrower if multiple contacts exist.
9. Press "Save" to return to the inventory.

### UML Class Diagram

Use the following updated UML class diagram to assist you with your understanding and implementation:
