1. **Advanced Object-Oriented Design:**

   - Mastery of creating modular, flexible, and reusable software through the application of object-oriented design principles and guidelines.
   - Acquisition of skills to analyze and design sophisticated software systems.

2. **Unified Modeling Language (UML):**

   - Proficiency in communicating complex designs through the use of Unified Modeling Language (UML), a standard visual notation for software modeling.

3. **Capstone Project Challenge:**

   - Application of acquired knowledge through a challenging Capstone Project involving the evolution and documentation of a Java codebase for an Android application, accompanied by comprehensive UML documentation.

4. **Key Achievements:**
   - Application of the Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) technique for robust problem analysis and object-oriented model design.
   - In-depth understanding and application of object-oriented modeling principles, encompassing abstraction, encapsulation, decomposition, and generalization.
   - Proficient knowledge and application of various types of inheritance.
   - Clear comprehension of association, aggregation, and composition dependencies.
   - Skill in expressing object-oriented models using UML class diagrams.
   - Ability to seamlessly translate between UML class diagrams and equivalent Java code.
   - Application of design guidelines for achieving modularity, separation of concerns, information hiding, and conceptual integrity, resulting in flexible, reusable, and maintainable designs.
   - Insight into the crucial tradeoff between cohesion and coupling in software design.

This course has not only enriched my Java skill set but has also empowered me with a robust foundation in object-oriented design principles, setting the stage for building high-quality, scalable software solutions.
